FL Translation & Analysis Toolkit

**Overview**

This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing the FL language and content. Currently, the repository includes:

- **FL Spreadsheet Creator**: A Python script that generates a translation spreadsheet from pairs of English and FL text, automatically removing duplicates and detecting conflicts.
- **FL Translator**: A Python script that uses the generated translation spreadsheet to translate new English text into the FL language or vice versa.
  
**Contents**
- FLSpreadsheetCreator.py: Script for creating and updating translation spreadsheets.
- FLTranslator.py: Script for translating new text using the spreadsheet as a language dictionary.
  
**Future Plans**
- Adding more tools to facilitate pattern analysis and machine learning exploration of FL content.
- Developing collaborative features to expand and share translation progress.
