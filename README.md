- Conflict Detection: If a new translation conflicts with an existing one, the user will be alerted before any changes are made.
- Duplicate Removal: The script automatically removes duplicate word pairs for clean and accurate tracking.
  
**Future Plans**
- Adding more tools to facilitate pattern analysis and machine learning exploration of FL content.
- Developing collaborative features to expand and share translation progress.
