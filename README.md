- `progress.md`: File containing recent model outputs, development notes, and a progress summary.
  
**Future Plans**
- Adding more tools to facilitate pattern analysis and machine learning exploration of FL content.
- Developing collaborative features to expand and share translation progress.
- Improving the machine learning model with expanded datasets to increase accuracy.
- Creating notebooks to provide interactive tutorials and demonstrations.
- Transitioning from word-level pairs to sentence-level data and utilizing seq2seq models with attention mechanisms to improve translation quality and contextual accuracy.
