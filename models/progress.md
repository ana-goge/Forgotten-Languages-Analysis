**Current Progress**
  
**Summary of Recent Output**  
The model was tested on a set of common words, with the following results:
- Accuracy: The model correctly predicted the translation for 5 out of 6 test words, with perfect confidence (1.0000) for most predictions.
- Vocabulary Coverage: The model has a vocabulary size of 601 English words and 597 FL words.

**Final Testing Translations**
- **light**: Predicted FL: (empty), Actual FL: unknown, Confidence: 0.8000
- **intelligence**: Predicted FL: aetheva, Actual FL: aetheva, Confidence: 1.0000, Match: True
- **and**: Predicted FL: beni, Actual FL: beni, Confidence: 1.0000, Match: True
- **in**: Predicted FL: neste, Actual FL: neste, Confidence: 1.0000, Match: True
- **computer**: Predicted FL: ikaik, Actual FL: ikaik, Confidence: 1.0000, Match: True
- **system**: Predicted FL: tese, Actual FL: tese, Confidence: 1.0000, Match: True

**Example Word Pairs**
- English: "a" -> FL: "eda"
- English: "abilities" -> FL: "teregerir"
- English: "ability" -> FL: "syka"
- English: "accelerating" -> FL: "tesideende"
- English: "accelerator" -> FL: "rerel"

**Next Steps for Improvement**
1. **Expand Dataset**: Add more data to the Excel sheet, especially focusing on missing or underrepresented words. This will help improve vocabulary coverage and reduce the occurrence of "unknown" results.

2. **Fine-tune Model**: Adjust the model parameters, or retrain with more data, to increase accuracy for words that currently result in low confidence or incorrect predictions.

3. **Conduct Broader Testing**: Test on a wider variety of words to identify additional gaps or patterns in performance, and refine the model accordingly.

_Notes_

- The model performs well on words that were well-represented in the dataset, with confidence scores consistently at 1.0000 for correct matches.
- Improving the dataset by adding more word pairs and ensuring diversity will be key to enhancing the model's capabilities and filling in current gaps.
- The translation model is still in a work-in-progress state and will not be be reliable for all English-FL translations at this stage.
